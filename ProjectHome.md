The process of refactoring helps developers maintain software over time, but software developers often do
not use existing tools to help them refactor their code. As a consequence, software developers are slower and
more error prone than had they used the tools in the Ô¨Årst place, contributing to the high cost of building
software. This project proposes to design and implement refactoring tools that support the developer in
her work rather than getting in her way.
